/**
 * EVERYTHING about taking over a core lives here: the capture pipeline AND the
 * actual core placement.
 *
 * Why it is more than one method: a capture happens over real time. The old
 * core dies, the hex sits empty for 5 seconds, then the attacker's Core Shard
 * appears. Time.run(delay, ...) runs code LATER on the main thread; we must
 * never block the thread to "wait". So the flow is cut into steps ONLY at the
 * points where it genuinely has to wait:
 *
 *   handleCoreChange     now      a core changed - is it really a death, and
 *                                 who captured it?
 *   startCapture         now      mark the hex captured, schedule the wipe
 *   captureClearHex      +1 tick  wipe the hex, attrition, hand over ownership,
 *                                 decide elimination + victory
 *   replaceCapturedCore  +5 s     wipe again (anti-abuse), place the Core Shard;
 *                                 retries every 60 ticks if the centre is blocked
 *
 * Every step does its own visible work and then schedules the next one at the
 * very end - no method just calls another. captureStepValid() is the single
 * shared "is this still the live capture?" guard.
 *
 * This class only asks TeamManager for shared round/team state (slots, victory,
 * elimination) through a handful of clearly named calls. TeamManager calls back
 * for exactly two things it reuses elsewhere: placeCore() (surrender restores
 * Fallen cores) and clearBuildingsInHex() (a new start hex is wiped first).
