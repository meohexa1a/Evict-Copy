# Evict Map Generator

A server-side Mindustry plugin for Evict-style persistent PvP on a procedurally generated hex map.

## Features

- Procedural hex-map generation with walls, passages, ores, water and oil
- Fallen team `#14` as the neutral owner of unclaimed cores
- Personal player teams with protected starting hexes, a start schematic and starting resources
- Core captures with a 5-second replacement delay, hex cleanup and captured Core Shards
- Elimination messages, claims and leader-managed `/invite` requests
- Capture and long-range unit attrition
- Core units can build and mine, but cannot damage buildings or units
- Building-fired bullets deal 10% damage to buildings while keeping normal
  damage against units
- Team-scoped `/fullassault` mode for unattended combat units
- `/die` surrender after 10 minutes, with a neutral 10-minute match-player
  status broadcast, and `/over` early round ending
- Timed Extinction late game with collapsing outer rings and a center-core final phase
- Async SQLite player data storage for profiles, playtime and FFA results
- Automatic random-seed round resets
- Persistent tuning for attrition, walls, ore/water generation and Extinction terrain streaming

## Player Commands

/help dev
/fullassault
/invite [number]
/die
/over
/time
```

## Development Commands

```text
/forceend
/extinction
/attritioncore [t1-3] [t4] [t5]
/attritionrange [percent]
/wall [full-wall] [small-wall] [open] [passage]
/corecap [additional-per-core]
/spawnunit [unit] [amount] [team]
/info [online-player] [team] [#number]
```

Extinction terrain streaming can be adjusted from the server console:

```text
evictextinctiontiles [amount]
```

Stored player data can be searched from the server console:

```text
evictplayerinfo [name/uuid]
```

Console player lookup searches the latest stored name first. Old stored names
and UUIDs are used only if no latest-name match exists. If multiple online
players match `/info`, the command shows numbered matches; use the shown
`#number` to pick one. Running `/info` without arguments opens a clickable
online-player selection menu.

Ore presets can be adjusted from the server console:

```text
evictcopper [scale] [threshold] [octaves] [falloff]
evictlead [scale] [threshold] [octaves] [falloff]
evictcoal [scale] [threshold] [octaves] [falloff]
evicttitanium [scale] [threshold] [octaves] [falloff]
evictthorium [scale] [threshold] [octaves] [falloff]
evictscrap [scale] [threshold] [octaves] [falloff]
```

Water patches can be adjusted from the server console:

```text
evictwater [tries-per-hex] [normal-patch-tiles] [large-patch-percent] [large-patch-tiles]
```

`tries-per-hex` is the water amount knob: `1` is the default/current amount.
Decimal values add a fractional extra try per hex, so `4.3` means 4 guaranteed
tries and a 30% chance for one more. The console command accepts either `4.3`
or `4,3`. `normal-patch-tiles` is the usual puddle size. `large-patch-percent`
is the chance that any one puddle becomes large, and `large-patch-tiles` is that
larger size. Default is
`evictwater 1 3 13.33 8`. Water/resource overlap is hard-coded; water tiles may
also carry ore overlays.

## Installation

Build the plugin JAR and place it in the Mindustry server `config/mods` folder. Clients do not need to install the plugin.
