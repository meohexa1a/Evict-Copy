# Evict Map Generator

A server-side Mindustry plugin for Evict-style persistent PvP on a procedurally generated hex map.

## Features

- Procedural hex-map generation with walls, passages, ores, water and oil
- Fallen team `#18` as the neutral owner of unclaimed cores
- Personal player teams with protected starting hexes, a start schematic and starting resources
- Core captures with a 5-second replacement delay, hex cleanup and captured Core Shards
- Elimination messages, claims and leader-managed `/invite` requests
- Capture and long-range unit attrition
- Team-scoped `/fullassault` mode for unattended combat units
- `/die` surrender and `/over` early round ending
- Timed Extinction late game with collapsing outer rings and a center-core final phase
- Automatic random-seed round resets
- Persistent tuning for attrition, walls and ore generation
